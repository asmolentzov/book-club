Project: Book Club

Group Member Names: Anna S and Mary G

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
Anna: A good understanding of Rails and testing. For sure get through all the user stories and aim to get started on the extensions. Solid understanding and execution of testing in Rails with RSpec and Capybara. A nice looking site.

Mary: An understanding of how to build applications in rails. To get through all the user stories and ideally the extensions. 100% test coverage with thoroughly written tests. More practice with CSS.

Goals and expectations: To fully complete the user stories and hopefully extensions. 3s and 4s for rubric.

Team strengths: TDD, following processes and procedures to achieve maximum efficiency with coding. Open communication.

How to overcome obstacles: Address an obstacle right when it comes up, ask each other first and then per Turing procedure: 30minutes, ask cohort, ask above mods, ask mentors, ask instructors. This applies also to any obstacles with communication.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): Basically every day after school, we already have google calendar appointments. We have scheduled time on the weekends, there are two times where one person is busy and we are going to see how the project is going and assign individual tasks according to that and the workload.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): Slack when we are both on and available, we also have each others cell phone numbers. We plan to communicate and/or check in every day during this project unless otherwise specified on a certain day.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
CSS improvement, generally improving memorization of the DSLs (ActiveRecord, Posgresql, Rails, Capybara, RSpec)
Really solidify our testing processes with feature/model testing.
Getting to a comfort level with where everything fits in the Rails structure of files along with naming.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Neither of us are particular about what features we work on, we just want to ensure that we both understand all aspects of the project.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
Git workflow: NEVER work on the master branch, name feature branches according to git issues/waffle.io cards, commit after each test is written, then commit after it is a passing test. We will be using waffle.io for an organization tool. We will be thorough with reviewing each other's code in github, as well as making thorough detailed comments before approval/if there are merge conflicts. We will be specific actionable and kind!

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Specific actionable and kind.

Agenda to discuss project launch: Tuesday at 430pm. We are taking this first night to wrap our heads around the project and then will kickoff our first test tomorrow!

Tools: Rails, waffle.io, slack screenshare

Additional Notes: none currently.
